## computer program, statements
A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. 

A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.
- they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language. 
- Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, itâ€™s probably a statement.

## functions
A function is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom).
