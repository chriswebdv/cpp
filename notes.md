## Notes for CPP
## computer program, statements
A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. 

A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.
- they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language. 
- Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, itâ€™s probably a statement.

## functions
A function is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom).
- Every C++ program must have a special function named main (all lower case letters). When the program is run, the statements inside of main are executed in sequential order.

## syntax
The rules that govern how sentences are constructed in a language is called syntax.

## Comments: single line and multi-line
// single time
/* multi-line

### comment out code, do the following:
- For VS Code users
You can comment or uncomment a selection by pressing ctrl-/

## summary
    At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe what.
    Inside the library, program, or function, use comments to describe how.
    At the statement level, use comments to describe why.

## programs
Programs are collections of instructions that manipulate data to produce a desired result.

## objects and naming them
An object is used to store a value in memory. A variable is an object that has a name (identifier).

Naming our objects let us refer to them again later in the program.

## instance
When the program is run (called runtime), the variable will be instantiated. Instantiation is a fancy word that means the 
object will be created and assigned a memory address. 

## data types
C++, the type of an object must be known at compile-time (when the program is compiled), and that type can not be changed without recompiling the program. 

## initializations
Prefer direct list initialization (or value initialization) for initializing your variables

Initialize your variables upon creation.
